Name,E143.n
Comment,g2bar data taken from page 87 in the paper. Bin in Q guessed by us. Additional normalization uncertainty 4.9%. The E143 experiment is the only one which presents g2-bar, therefore the uncertainties are solely the stat+syst of said g2-bar, unlike the rest of the experimental tables
