Name,E143.p
Comment,g2bar data taken from page 86 in the paper. Bin in Q guessed by us. Additional normalization uncertainty 3.7%. The E143 experiment is the only one which presents g2-bar, therefore the uncertainties are solely the stat+syst of said g2-bar, unlike the rest of the experimental tables
